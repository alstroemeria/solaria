# Minting

:::tip
**Solaris is mining on March 13 @5PM UTC**.  We've put together a guide to help you navigate through the different steps you'll need to follow. For details on the process and timeline, go to Rollout.
:::

## Preparing a Wallet

To mint an NFT on the Solana blockchain, you'll need both Solana (SOL) and a wallet that can hold your NFT. We recommend using [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) as your wallet of choice.

### Creating a Wallet

First, create an Solana wallet that you can use to conduct your transactions and hold your NFTs. Your Solana wallet will have a public address on the Solana network, which is where you can send and receive tokens like SOL and NFTs.

### Buying SOL
The easiest way to buy `SOL`, the currency used on Solana, is to use a crypto exchange. We recommend Coinbase for beginners. Note that this Coinbase.com account is different from a Coinbase Wallet account — it is an account for Coinbase's exchange, which allows you to trade currencies like USD for cryptocurrencies like Solana.

1. Create an account and buy some SOL.
2. Once you've bought your SOL, transfer it by sending it to the address of the wallet you just created earlier. Now you're ready to mint an NFT!

:::info
Make sure that you have more SOL than you need for the cost of the mint — each Solana transaction requires "gas," the network fees that go into processing blockchain transactions. For example, the Solaris cost 2 SOL each to mint, so you may want to have 2.1 SOL per property on hand.

:::note
We'll also be enabling a credit card option that will not require a wallet. Skip down to the "credit card" section[below](mint.md/#credit-cards)

## Minting


You'll need to connect your wallet to our website using the "Connect Wallet" button — a modal will open, and you'll need to choose the wallet type you created earlier.

### Pre-sale Mint (Whitelist)
Whitelist is done through Solana tokens. If you've been allocated a token as part of your DAO's allocation or community participation you will see the following button before the public phase.

:::caution
If you've obtained the `whitelisted` role in our discord you still need to submit your wallet on our `#wallet-submission` channel on discord to get tokens sent to your wallet before the mint. The last day to do so is on March 12th.

If you do not have a whitelist token during the mint, you will see this option is disabled. **Stick around, the public phase opens a few hours after the pre-sale!**

### Public Mint

**Our public mint starts 3 hours after the presale.** We've allocated supply outside our whitelist so that we can guarantee remaining supply for a public mint. If you've already minted from the whitelist but want to collect more, nows the time to press the `mint` button!

Once your wallet is connected, click "Mint," and you should see an overview of the transaction you're about to create in your wallet, with the option to confirm it. In most cases, the transaction should take a few seconds to complete. Hooray, you've just minted your NFT!

#### Credit Cards
We will also be partnering with our friends from Crossmint to enable "Buy with credit card" during the public phase. You will be guided thought onboarding with [Crossmint](https://www.crossmint.io/) to complete the transactions.
