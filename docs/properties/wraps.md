# Wrapping
Billboards light up a city. Wrapping is a feature that lets 
property owners customize the exterior appearance of their properties. 
Data is stored off-chain and there are are no fees associated with updating
a wrap. Wraps allow our community to make changes that affect the
way our city renders and are the first thing users can see when
visiting our city.

:::note
Wrapping is an experimental feature. This feature is subject to evolve and change as
we upgrade the rendering capabilities for Aether over time.

## User Guide

For existing property owners, you'll need to visit your property 
page (For example: https://aethercity.org/32). To login press `Connect` authenticate your permissions; we use this to ensure that you are the current owner of the property. Under
the `⚙ Gear` menu from the property page you will see an option for `🎁 Wrap`

:::tip
The menu option will not appear if your currently authenticated wallet is not the owner of the property.
:::

For *Units*, all 4 compass directions can be personalized. For
*Buildings*, the 2 dominant compass directions of the district
will determine which faces of the building can be customized. We
limit the number of faces to preserve the look and feel of Aether.

The uploaded image will be center-cropped onto the respective face
of the property. In order to optimize placement and to prevent
stretching, it is recommend that you upload an image with the same
aspect ratio of your property. You can see the recommended values
from the tooltip for each compass direction during submission.
