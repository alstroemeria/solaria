# Customization

Each Aether property can be personalized to the owners choosing. Personalization
can be stored both on and off-chain. In our current implementation `v1`, we allow owners to customize
the following fields:

1. Title
2. Description
3. Link
4. Image

# Quick Start

Visit your property permalink. If you are connected and the owner of this property you will
have special access to the property menu.

Selecting `Edit` will display the following options. This will allow you to make changes to
your property. The default option is to have data stored off-chain. This means that the
updated metadata is stored on our servers.

:::tip

We recommend that new users opt-in to use our `off-chain` storage options. While ownership
is secured and backed by the block-chain, it's up to the beholder to put a value on
on-chain storage.

Alternatively you may opt in to storing data on-chain. This form of storage will cost gas
fees as you will be writing data directly on to the block-chain.
