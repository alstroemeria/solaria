# Customization

Each Solaris property can be personalized to the owners choosing. Personalization
can be stored both on and off-chain. In our current implementation we allow owners to customize
the following fields:

1. Title
2. Description
3. Link
4. Image

# Quick Start

Visit your property permalink. If you are connected and the owner of this property you will
have special access to the property menu.

Selecting `Edit` will display the following options. This will allow you to make changes to
your property.
