# Types

Aether consists of a finite amount of property that can be
found under 3 different categories: **Units**, **Buildings**, and **Districts**.
Individuals or collectives with ownership of Aether properties have
control over its contents and are free to create exclusive Web3
experiences.

## Units

A unit is the smallest unit of property ownership in Aether. It is a
property that is defined by its coordinates occupying an space of
1³. A unit is a part of a building and is adjacent to neighbouring
units. The owner of a unit determines its appearance, fills it with
content, and has the ability to connect the unit to its own domain.

:::tip
Units make up the most majority of Aether properties, as such we recommend
that new members start from here.

## Buildings

A building is a property that is defined by its coordinates and
size. The first unit level is managed by the building owner. A
building’s space is also occupied by a number of units. A building’s
height expands with the progression factor in Aether. The maximum
number of units that a building can home is defined by the
building’s space and height and therefore grows as the world
progresses to equilibrium.

A building can have an exclusive owner, who creates the design of
the building and has the ability to connect the building to its own
domain.

:::note
Buildings are the seeds of the city and are not meant for
entry level investors. Just like how it would be difficult for one
individual to afford a skyscraper in New York City.

## Districts

A district is a property that is defined by its coordinates and
size. A district holds any number of buildings. It may have an
exclusive own owner, who manages the district and has the ability to
connect the district to its own domain.{' '}

:::note
Districts are top level regions that will not be released to the
public at this time. They are meant for the division of the city
and will be managed by community leaders in the future.
