# Types

Solaris consists of a finite amount of property that can be
found under 2 different categories: **Units** and **Buildings**.
Individuals or collectives with ownership of Solaris properties have
control over its contents and are free to create exclusive Web3
experiences.

## Units

A unit is the smallest unit of property ownership in Solaris. It is a
property that is defined by its coordinates occupying an space of
1³. A unit is a part of a building and is adjacent to neighbouring
units. The owner of a unit determines its appearance, fills it with
content, and has the ability to connect the unit to its own domain.

:::tip
Units make up the most majority of Solaris properties, as such we recommend
that new members start from here.

## Buildings

A building is a property that is defined by its coordinates and
size. The first unit level is managed by the building owner. A
building’s space is also occupied by a number of units. A building can have
an exclusive owner, who creates the design of
the building and has the ability to connect the building to its own
domain.

:::note
Building surfaces are high-value advertising spaces and are not meant for
entry level investors. Just like how it would be difficult for one
individual to afford a skyscraper in New York City.
