# Privacy

You may have noticed that buildings are marked either **Private** or **Public**. This field
was used during the initial launch of Aether. Private buildings restrict minting
privileges to the owner exclusively, public buildings can be minted by anyone.

Public buildings were a strategy to allow anyone to mint an Aether unit. We originally had
set half of Aether's building to be public. After the distribution of buildings in *September 2021*,
Aether's central buildings (Generation 0) are predominately privately owned.

Building owners can maximize the future utility of buildings by toggling the privacy flag to `Private`. 
Building owners can change this value at anytime, this transaction will incur gas fees.
