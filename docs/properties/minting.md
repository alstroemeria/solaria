# Minting

If a building has spots available to mint you can do so by opening the mint page from the property menu. The current cost
of minting a unit is `0.05 ETH`. The availability of minting is determined by the city progression factor and the
inherent height of the building. You can view the **Attributes** section of a property to learn more about available spaces and
future potential.

:::warning
Minting is currently **exclusive** to Building owners as all current available placements are privately owned.
