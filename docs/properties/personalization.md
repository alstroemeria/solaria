# Personalization

Each Solaris property can be personalized to the owners choosing. Owners use this feature to host their presence in our virtual world. Anyone who scans the QR code on the backing NFT will be redirected to your property. Anyone who is browsing Solaris will also be able to see this information.

Personalization is stored off-chain and require no gas fees. In our current implementation we allow owners to customize
the following fields:

```
1. Title
2. Description
3. Link
4. Image
```

## Quick Start

Visit your property permalink. If you are connected and the owner of this property you will
have special access to the property menu under the `Gear âš™`. Selecting `Edit` will display additional options for you to edit. This will allow you to make changes to your property.
