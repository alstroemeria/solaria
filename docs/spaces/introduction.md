# Spaces

Spaces are immersive Solaris experiences that exist in the comfort of
your browser. With the creation of new NFTs everyday, an
interoperable space is the key to bringing your collections
together. Now you can make Solaris your primary space in the
metaverse. Share your Space with your friends. Learn about our
community through their spaces. Discover beautiful NFT collections

## User Guide

### Demo

Visit [https://solaris.so/space](https://Solariscity.org/space)
to begin. These public Spaces are mapped 1:1 with a connected wallet address. These spaces will not be
discoverable on Solaris at this time however we're looking for
amazing collectors to join our community all the time. Show us how
you would curate your space and win one of our property giveaways!

### Members

Visit your property page to begin.
Each property in Solaris maps 1:1 to a Space. This allows visitors to visit
your properties and discover your NFT collections. You can find a link to the *Space* on a
property's page. You can also discover properties with a Space on
our Discover page. Move in the space using the
`WASD` and `space` keys.
Orbit your viewpoint by dragging the mouse. Interact with objects by
clicking on them.

For property *owners*, `connect` to Solaris from the
home page. If your space has never been personalized you will need
to access your space from the `âš™ Gear` menu.
Only spaces that have been personalized will display the primary
`Space` button to *visitors*.
