# Spaces

Spaces are immersive Aether experiences that exist in the comfort of
your browser. With the expansion of new collectables everyday, an
interoperable web3 space is the key to bringing your collections
together. Now you can make Aether your primary space in the
metaverse. Share your Space with your friends. Learn about our
community through their spaces. Discover beautiful NFT collections

For a quick demo, click [here](https://aethercity.org/space)
to begin. *Discovery and advanced features are limited to Aether
property holders but anyone can create galleries in seconds to
share them through a direct link.*

## Quick Start

### Public Tier

Visit [https://aethercity.org/space](https://aethercity.org/space) 
to begin. These public Spaces are mapped 1:1 with a connected wallet address, you 
can share direct links to view this space. These spaces will not be
discoverable on Aether at this time however we're looking for
amazing collectors to join our community all the time. Show us how
you would curate your space and win one of our property giveaways!

### Owner Tier

Visit your property page to begin (ex: [https://aethercity.org/32](https://aethercity.org/32)).
Each property in Aether maps 1:1 to a Space. This allows visitors to visit
your properties and discover your collections.

For property *visitors*, you can find a link to the *Space* on a
property's page. You can also discover properties with a Space on
our Discover page. Move in the space using the
`WASD` and `space` keys.
Orbit your viewpoint by dragging the mouse. Interact with objects by
clicking on them.

For property *owners*, `connect` to Aether from the
home page. If your space has never been personalized you will need
to access your space from the `âš™ Gear` menu.
Only spaces that have been personalized will display the primary
`Space` button to visitors.
