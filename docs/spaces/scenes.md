# Scenes

At the launch of Space we have included core scenes for our community
to experiement with. These scenes are custom to Aether's platform and are
currently optimized for NFT Galleries. Each Space is crafted and optimized
to run in browser to create a rich web3 experience. 

:::tip
We're looking to do a lot more with Spaces by introducing additional scenes this year. Stay tuned! ðŸŽ‰

## Genesis
Our first Space, titled <i>Genesis</i>, is a modern art gallery.
Genesis is modeled after our experiences at 
[The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Museum_of_Modern_Art)
. It's warm and minimal interior is crafted to showcase your most
cherished NFT collections. This Space has a total of 26 frames that
owners can customize.

## Ethos

Ethos is modular gallery that gives you the flexibility to either highlight
a single NFT or an entire PFP collection with ease. **Currently access to *Ethos*
is restricted to Building owners only.** We are exploring how we can use this 
a basis for modular and custom congifuration of larger spaces.
