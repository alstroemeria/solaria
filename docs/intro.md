# Introduction

**Aether is the first virtual city powered by the Ethereum blockchain.** 
Our city is shaped by properties stored on the blockchain.
Individuals and collectives with ownership of these properties have
control over the content and are free to create unique web3
experiences. To make this all possible, Aether uses blockchain
technology as an unforgeable record of ownership. Our vision is to
be the largest blockchain based community.

Aether is a platform for personal spaces, communities, shopping,
and businesses. Aether is a network of these properties connected
through a visualized environment to allow for discovery. The
platform is defined in a smart contract powered by the Ethereum
blockchain. Aether property tokens, `AETH` are 
`ERC721 (NFT)` tokens that define ownership within
the Aether metaverse. The register of properties and accounting
functions are written to the blockchain ensuring ownership
security.

## Properties

Aether City consists of a finite amount of property that can be
found under 3 different categories: Units, Buildings, and Districts. 
Users can fill any property with applications, collectables, multimedia,
and much more.

### Units

A unit is the smallest unit of property ownership in Aether. It is a
property that is defined by its coordinates occupying an space of
1³. A unit is a part of a building and is adjacent to neighbouring
units. The owner of a unit determines its appearance, fills it with
content, and has the ability to connect the unit to its own domain.
Lets take a look at some examples.

### Buildings

A building is a property that is defined by its coordinates and
size. The first unit level is managed by the building owner. A
building’s space is also occupied by a number of units. A building’s
height expands with the progression factor in Aether. The maximum
number of units that a building can home is defined by the
building’s space and height and therefore grows as the world
progresses to equilibrium.

A building can have an exclusive owner, who creates the design of
the building and has the ability to connect the building to its own
domain. Buildings are the seeds of the city and are not meant for
entry level investors. Just like how it would be difficult for one
individual to afford a building in real life.

### Districts
 A district is a property that is defined by its coordinates and
size. A district holds any number of buildings. It may have an
exclusive own owner, who manages the district and has the ability to
connect the district to its own domain.{' '}


> Districts are top level regions that will not be released to the
  public at this time. They are meant for the division of the city
  and will be managed by community leaders in the future.


## World Mechanics
Aether’s buildings are pre-determined by a procedural algorithm and are then seeded into the world contract. Buildings fill up the universe as more people join. Since the city is centered at an origin point at (0,0) we incentivize early investors by letting them shape the heart of the city. Building locations are immutable and building heights increase alongside the natural progression of the world. For example, a building may only be at half of its final height if the world has only reach half of its total capacity.
