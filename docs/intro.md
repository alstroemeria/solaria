# Introduction

Launched in March 11, 2018, Aether is the one of the first metaverse projects powered by the Ethereum blockchain.


Aether is a platform for personal spaces, communities, shopping,
and businesses. Our world is realized as a collective of properties connected
through a visualized Web3 environment. The
platform is powered by a smart contract on the Ethereum
blockchain. Aether property tokens, `AETH`, are
`ERC721` NFT tokens that define ownership within
the Aether metaverse. The register of properties and accounting
functions are written to the blockchain creating a secure form of ownership.
