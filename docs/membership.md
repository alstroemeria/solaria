# Membership


<!-- :::info
You can view our live demo of these NFTs and their properties [here](https://www.solaris.so/membership)
::: -->

Solaris's NFTs represent both virtual properties and memberships to the Solaris platform. Our current pre-mint demo showcases a
world with a `~5000` supply. Of this, `~200` are `buildings`, `~400` are `penthouses`, `~4,400`
`units`. Each NFT is backed by an image asset corresponding with the unique property owned by the holder of the token.

:::info
Since our mint is by Candy Machine, all tiers of membership will be accessible by minters. Our membership combines, density, location, size, and tiering that will all attribute to an NFT's rarity.

 For reference, on Aether, unit floor is `~0.8ETH`, penthouse  `~1.5ETH`, buildings `~7ETH`. ([Aether OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/aether))

community today and make it yours.

## Penthouse (Unit)
Penthouses are units that occupy the highest floor of a building. Penthouses are the most prized units in a building due to
their ease of access and amazing views. We also plan to provide an exclusive Space scene to this tier in the future.

## Partner (Building)
Buildings are the first properties that people see when visiting Solaris. These surfaces end up being incredibly valuable
advertising spaces. As a owner you have control over the first level of the building but do not have control of the units within
it (unless you own those too). Buildings are intended for our largest partners; for example a DAO might acquire a building in
order to hold a prominent position in the city. We offer an exclusive NFT gallery scene to this tier of ownership.
